# L01 - Introduction to Next.js

-   **Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications**.
-   It extends React by providing additional features for production-ready apps, such as routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, and compiling.
-   It simplifies web development by offering features like:

    1. Routing (File-based routing)
    2. API Routes (making it full-stack)
    3. Rendering Flexibility (server-side and client-side)
    4. Streamlined Data Fetching
    5. Flexible Styling
    6. Built-In Optimizations (images, fonts, scripts)
    7. Optimized Dev and Build Systems

-   Next.js favors **Conventions over Configuration**, meaning you often don't need to install or configure external packages for core features.
-   **Prerequisites:** HTML, CSS, modern JavaScript, and a good understanding of React fundamentals (function components, props, state, JSX, hooks).
